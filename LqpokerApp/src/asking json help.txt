im having a json file which i try to get my data from, i have used jsonlint to checkthe json.

as java doesnt use json, i had to get the gson lib into the project.

so when i tried to get an object or array from the file, with the code 
deel = gson.fromJson(deelnemers, Deelnemers.class); (deel = Deelnemers class, deelnemers = string)
i also have tried 
jsonobject = gson.fromJson(deelnemer, Deelnemer.class);(jsonobject =jsonobject, deelnemer = string)


i keep getting the error Expected BEGIN_OBJECT but was STRING at line 1 column 1 path $
or BEGIN_Array.



I have no clue what to do now, i have looked up at the error but i coud not find a solution to my problem,
some of the tries:
